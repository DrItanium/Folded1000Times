1: Style swapping needs to be polished.
 ^- Ranged style
   B: Forward special (In, needs new graphics/sounds)
   C: Side special (In, needs new graphics/sounds)
   D: Back special
 ^- Trickster style
   B: Forward special (In, needs new graphics/sounds)
 ^- Some kind of visual effect after swapping
   (Orbs flying around you?)

10: The trickster grapplebeam can lag people out when people teleport and go a long way away from the source. Is there a way to have the beam snap when teleporting?
10b: Alternatively, rehaul grapplebeam completely. Two notches for one pull beam is not good.
12: Separate Hae-Lin's pickups from Shihong's. Berserk/Megasphere/Soul shard done, still need to do:
 ^- Radsuit (Coolant)
 ^- Armor (Needs more tech-y armor instead of Hae-Lin's slabs of silver/gold)
 ^- Invulnsphere (Zero point force field)
13: Blursphere replacement
19: A way to switch away from grenades before you throw them?
20: Polish up the jet thruster.
 ^- More consistent jet sound.
 ^- Some kind of trail flowing around.
24: More consistent coloring/shading for the HUD.


1: Style swapping needs to be in.
 ^- Melee style (Needs a name)
   A: Passive buff (Faster melee speed, hits harder)
   B: Forward special
   C: Side special
   D: Back special
 ^- Ranged style (Needs a name)
   A: Passive buff (Bullets get tracers, ranking bonus partially applies to guns)
 ^- Trickster style
   A: Passive buff (Can grab walls, jetpack regenerates faster. In, needs separated)
   C: Side special
   D: Back special (In, needs new graphics/sounds)
 ^- Unique icons showing what the styles are
   A: Gold Fist
   B: Blue Gun
   C: Purple dodging icon?
 ^- Different color than purple for trickster (Magenta. Fairly red-ish, but still purple)
2: Soul acquiring mechanic
 ^- Separate Shihong's bullets from Hae-Lin's
3: Rehaul the Teleport/Dash entirely into a jet thruster.
4: BFG9000 replacement
5: Gameplay mechanic for Triumph sword (What happens when you get higher ammo? What can you use it for?)
6: Muzzle flash for Striker revolver (Two, one for normal shot and one for final shot)
7: Original sounds for low on health (look at Pres' submitted Marathon sounds, find source stock sounds)
8: New HUD
9: Better names for Avenger/Enforcer/Rebellion
 ^- Challenger
 ^- Ruin
 ^- Hunter
11: Separate Hae-Lin's quotes from Shihong's
 ^- Find a voice actress
12: Separate Hae-Lin's pickups from Shihong's. Berserk/megasphere/soul shard done, still need to do:
 ^- Soul Prison (GIGANTIC car battery? Fusion core?)
 ^- Backpack (Combat backpack? Ammo briefcase?)
14: Allmap replacement
15: What to do with Rebellion? Dual-wielding is fun, and dual-wielding pistols in a stylish action game is kind of mandatory. But the current execution is very eehhh. The Striker is more accurate, the Avenger does more damage, and the Enforcer is faster, and tapping away rapidly at the keys to try and get the damage edge is clunky and unwieldy.
 ^- Alternate burst-fire mode. Hold-down fire for a rapid trio of shots from both guns.
16: 19 spawning sounds
17: Spawning animation for guns.
 ^- Pickup sprites for weapons
18: Flashlight replacement for Shihong (night vision?)
20: Polish up the jet thruster.
 ^- Buffer--doesn't just automatically turn on if you hold down Run at low values.
 ^- Fine-tune the values of speed/cost/recovery.
 ^- Adjust the recovery. Once you're on the ground again, it can recover steadily even if you jump?
 ^- The higher up your view is, the lesser the boost. Otherwise it's too easy for people to just fly straight up.
  ^- Make a smoother curve
21: Unique weapon swapping sound.
 ^- Different one for the sword.
22: Dying with grapple done doesn't cancel on death.
23: Is it possible to make melee attacks home in on enemies in melee style? [Nope]
25: +SKYEXPLODE on the grenades?
