FROM V1c TO V2:
===========================
- 100 more songs!
- Removed and replaced Rammstein's Engel with Feuer Frei, due to Engel messing up
  in-game and playing ring tones instead.
- Added a "default song" button to play the level's standard music.
- Moved all song info to LANGUAGE, for people to edit at their leisure if they
  replace the music.
- Messages now no longer overlap and will replace each other.
- Necroticism - Descanting the Insalubrious had an unreadable symbol that was
  refusing to be read properly.
- Corrected some mistaken song information:
  ^- A Succubus In Rapture was not by set_abominae, it was by Dimmu Borgir.
  ^- Rammstein has identified as Neue Deutsche Harte.
  ^- Annihilator has never identified their genre as groove metal.
  ^- Biohazard has identified as Hardcore.
  ^- Ea, Lord of the Depths was on the album Burzum.
  ^- Alice in Chains is decisively Grunge.
  ^- The Midnight Carnival is Speed, not Power.
  ^- Children of Bodom's songs have been labeled Melodic Death.
  ^- Fear Factory is Industrial Metal, not Death Metal.
  ^- Graveworm is now Melodic Black Metal.
  ^- Hexen is now Thrash Metal.
  ^- Lamb of God is now metalcore.
  ^- Refuse/Resist was on Chaos A.D.
