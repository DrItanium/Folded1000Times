FROM V2 TO V3:
===========================
- 60 more songs!
- Judas Priest's Tyrant had a random beep around the 0:56-ish mark. This has been
  fixed.
- Dark ambient music has been removed and replaced. This is a pack for jamming to
  super-cheesy and tinny music, not getting 2spook'd.
- White Zombie's Temple of the Bull wasn't a song we were able to find any info
  on. We're not even sure it's actually a real song. It was replaced with a new
  White Zombie song, Black Sunshine.
- It's now possible to change exactly to the song you want. Input "song" and then
  a number in the console, like "song 142", and it'll swap to that exact song.
- All song info has been given tan and white coloring for easier differentiation.
- Corrected some mistaken song information:
  ^- Barathrum's Warmetal is off the album Infernal.
  ^- Linkin Park's Crawling is off the album Hybrid Theory.
  ^- Battlelore's Stormmaster was renamed to the proper Swordmaster.
  ^- Song 186 was credited to Cannical Corpse instead of Cannibal Corpse.
  ^- Sanctuary's Die for My Sins and Taste Revenge are Thrash Metal.


FROM V1c TO V2:
===========================
- 100 more songs!
- Removed and replaced Rammstein's Engel with Feuer Frei, due to Engel messing up
  in-game and playing ring tones instead.
- Added a "default song" button to play the level's standard music.
- Moved all song info to LANGUAGE, for people to edit at their leisure if they
  replace the music.
- Messages now no longer overlap and will replace each other.
- Necroticism - Descanting the Insalubrious had an unreadable symbol that was
  refusing to be read properly.
- Corrected some mistaken song information:
  ^- A Succubus In Rapture was not by set_abominae, it was by Dimmu Borgir.
  ^- Rammstein has identified as Neue Deutsche Harte.
  ^- Annihilator has never identified their genre as groove metal.
  ^- Biohazard has identified as Hardcore.
  ^- Ea, Lord of the Depths was on the album Burzum.
  ^- Alice in Chains is decisively Grunge.
  ^- The Midnight Carnival is Speed, not Power.
  ^- Children of Bodom's songs have been labeled Melodic Death.
  ^- Fear Factory is Industrial Metal, not Death Metal.
  ^- Graveworm is now Melodic Black Metal.
  ^- Hexen is now Thrash Metal.
  ^- Lamb of God is now metalcore.
  ^- Refuse/Resist was on Chaos A.D., not Confuse A.D.
  ^- Reviewers have identified Celtic Frost's To Mega Therion (not Thyrion)
     album as Death Metal.
