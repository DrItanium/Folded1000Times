TO DO in no particular order:
20: Mid-air flight sounds for projectiles, so as to easily gauge location.
22: Randomized muzzleflashes for the pistol.
30: Easy path to S--find group of enemies, sword-dash into them
32: <TerminusEst13> ...I wonder if there's a way I can choke how much [combo meter] is given at once.
    <ijon> store the amount you have right when you start the attack
    <ijon> have ACS or custominventory or something check that and only give you more if it'd place you no more than X above that count
37: Pretty up all non-laser enemy attacks.
  ^ Revenant
  ^ Baron of Hell/Hell Knight
  ^ Archvile
  ^ Mancubus
43: GLDEFS
44: Expand on final map
49: Replacement for Wolfenstein SS
50: Bisected enemies somehow get caught in the ceiling
51: Player sprites for Jung Hae-Lin and Iron Maiden
52: Special charge-up laser-hadouken for Iron Maiden
53: Iron Maiden polishing
  ^ Design
  ^ New HUD signifying you're in armor
  ^ Non-placeholder sprites for fists/pickup
53: Special attacks for guns as well? Hold down fire and tap alt-fire to activate a stylish move with the gun?
54: Casing ejection/smoke effects on the guns.
55: New teleport effect
56: People have been asking to wield the Kharon by itself, without any guns in alt-hand. Alt-fire would be infinite throwing knives, or alternate Kharon attacks?
57: Chopping barrels slices through them, releasing gas. Shooting the gas, causes explosions.
58: Attack when you let go of holding down fire.
59: Less/no-effects cvar
61: 6000 ANGRY BEES: one small idea to toy with:
6000 ANGRY BEES: subtle sound cues when you go up or down a combo level (fearless etc.)
TerminusEst13: That's a good idea, actually.
6000 ANGRY BEES: maybe layer additional sounds under the sword swing sound for each combo level, increasingly unsubtle
6000 ANGRY BEES: so combo level 1 adds a slight whine to the sword slash, while max combo level is the quad damage sound
TerminusEst13: That'd add some really visceral feedback, and it'd definitely encourage going even harder and faster--just so you can see those neat effects even more.
TerminusEst13: Plus it'd make sense from an in-universe perspective, since the sword is eating souls in a stereotypical edgy 90s fashion.
64: [12:37:27 am] DRL 3.33: would be nice if torches had a chance to drop peppers
65: Look into adapting Pres' wandering-soul system for others to pick up.
68: Draining the Iron Maiden's armor and then letting it recover seems to let damage bleed through to the player.
69: Let the player know on the HUD what weapons they've already picked up.
70: Some kind of "don't mash the button for more powerful strikes" system.
71: A cvar to let people swap between weapons when out of ammo.
72: Skulltag weapon replacements?



<torridGristle> I think an jumpng uppercut / upperslash would be cool in DemonSteele and provide a useful tool.
<torridGristle> Send an enemy into the air for a little bit so they stop shooting.
<torridGristle> Help with crowd control without resorting to something like the grenade launcher.
<torridGristle> Maybe some sick air combos
<TerminusEst13> Hmmm. Don't think I can do air combos, but an uppercut/upperslash would be good for releasing a hold if you don't double-tap a direction.
<torridGristle> I was thinking it'd be a normal attack that you don't need to charge your meter for.
<Eric> it'd be neat if attacking mid-air would let you stay up a bit longer
<Eric> would help with flying jerkasses that just won't come down and let you cut them
<torridGristle> Could dashes be made three-dimensional in the air?
<TerminusEst13> torrid: Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. Instead of doing a special attack, you just cancel the thing. What I'm discovering is common behavior for players to strike, hold an attack, dodge through, and then finish an enemy off with a special attack. I think it'd be kind of lame to limit that to special attacks, so a non-soul-using attack that can be done might be good.
<torridGristle> Need to be able to do it quickly.
<torridGristle> Since I mean for it to be crowd control tech, dash into a bunch of zombies and send one or two flying each time and attack some while others are stunned.
<TerminusEst13> Eric: I can try. Theoretically it'd be as simple as lowering the player's gravity if they're in mid-air, so the big question would be how to keep the player from flying off.
<torridGristle> Can you add downward momentum over time?
<Eric> i was thinking more along the lines of little boosts with each sword swing that would be just enough to keep you up, without letting you fly into the heavens
<TerminusEst13> Aahhhh. Hmm. That'd just be a simple ThrustThingZ, then, I believe.
<Eric> that might get ugly online, but in my opinion demonsteele isn't particularly good for that in the first place
<torridGristle> Will ThrustThingZ only move you forward? In mid-air combat against flying enemies, being able to angle your thrusts up would be helpful.
<torridGristle> No, Z is up isn't it
<torridGristle> I'm thinking of Minecraft's xyz designation.
<TerminusEst13> Z only bothers with up and down. For forward/backward it'd be either A_Recoil or ThrustThing.


<PresidentPeople> Also I suggested slash decals and coopinfo displaying combo meter


<PresidentPeople> TerminusEst13: Wraithverge needs to be in butts.txt
<TerminusEst13> butts.txt has been deleted.
<TerminusEst13> rip
<PresidentPeople> Replaced with to_do.txt, same thing :P
<TerminusEst13> Brb renaming to_do.txt to butts.txt
<Roman6a> >no butts.txt
<Roman6a> dead mod
<TerminusEst13> fug you i just put it back in
<Roman6a> oh, good
<PresidentPeople> >Wraithverge still isn't on it


[04:31:35 pm] Badass adorkable: i want a bonerstorms caused by ironmeido mode kills to be a shotgun blasts
[04:32:02 pm] TerminusEst13: That...actually sounds like a cool idea for a special move.
[04:32:16 pm] TerminusEst13: Kill a dude so hard his bones rocket out and shred through other dudes.
[04:32:35 pm] Badass adorkable: not as much shred as much as PAAAAAAIN
[04:32:53 pm] Badass adorkable: kill a pinkie to stun pinkies behind it
[04:33:30 pm] DRL 3.33: instead of gibing, they explode, damageing other monsters around them




PVP-ONLY WOES: // Yes, some people actually tried PvP with this. Yes, these people have suggestions about fixing things.
- Invulnerability time needs to be much shorter
- You shouldn't get the sound/fade-in on respawn
- Obituaries need to be tied to weapons/bullets.
- Sword slashes go through players
- Player skin REALLY does not help in identifying team members
- Something needs to encourage using the sword over the guns
- Too easy for players to just camp health items with the invulnerability. Maybe a health cap? Maybe remove larger health spawns?





LATER, MAYBE:
35: Replace generic blood with something of neater substance, like Psychic's or a smaller version of AtM's. // Nope, didn't work for some reason. I'll figure it out later.






NOPE:
29: SASS RAINBOW: you should make berserk give free combos for 20 seconds // Berserk was made into a pepper
38: I can include different melee styles, each with their own focus. People have been constantly suggesting more DMC inspiration, so one thing I could do is borrow the four "styles" of play and do different melee modes around that.
Like one style is to tap repeatedly for really fast strikes (what's currently in).
Another style is retro SNES-style beat-'em-up combos where landed hits go into other hits.
Another style is single strikes, where holding down fire charges up a more powerful strike.
And the final style...ummm. Hm. // Kharon being wielded by itself will cover this.


DONE:
1a: Code Mike's new deaths
1b: Implement found headshot dead sprites--imps/zombies/shotgunners will be finished!
2: Make aura placeholders for Zael's Slayer of Light
3: Hammer overcharge crashes online play--due to HammerLightningLonger sucking up all the bandwidth. Find alternative?
4: Find names for the weapons, make pickup sounds and sprites
5: Convert custominventory weapon pickups from Inventory.PickupSound to A_PlaySoundEx, currently don't activate with sv_weaponstay
6: More destructable environmental stuff
7: Figure out what armor pickups should be
8: Berserk pickup sprite/sound
9: Cvar to remove recoil for semi-purist play.
10: Port in Mike's pistol sprites
11: More dramatic sound/effect for dodging
12: Back-back-slash is a wide sword beam shooting ahead a repulsive wave to defend yourself with
13: Forward, Left, right, and both attack buttons activates Iron Maiden mode
14: Redo shotgunner's/chaingunner's firing sound.
15: Give newer, prettier graphic for zombie laser shots than just an NES Contra sprite.
16: M_DOOM logo
17: Polish up hammer's placeholder sprites--they're just placeholder, but they don't need to be so damn ugly
18: Sound on enemy-laser impact
19: Give each of the guns/special attacks their own damagetype.
21: Stylize up the HUD a little.
23: Replace not-especially-demonic enemies with recolored/tweaked Heretic/Hexen enemies for more \m/ METAL \m/
    SPECTRE: Steel Beast
    CACODEMON: Wizard
    ARACHNOTRON: Priest
    PAIN ELEMENTAL: Blackened
    SPIDER MASTERMIND: Emperor
24: Include Shivers' idle animation
25: Respawning gives too much health
26: In multiplayer people can cut each other up for combo
27: sv_unblockplayers allows people to go through enemies.
28: Less particle spam on Exodus.
31: Fountain-blood corpses seem to be looping endlessly online.
33: Make all enemy projectiles go A_UnsetShootable on death.
34: Replace explosive barrels with something of neater substance.
36: Edit the LANGUAGE lump and replace existing messages with more metal references.
37: Pretty up all non-laser enemy attacks.
  ^ Imp
  ^ Cyberdemon
39: Replace graphics on main menu options.
40: Lightning sparks from hammer overcharge need to +DONTSPLASH
41: Why do the Hell Nobles/Cacos not have colored blood wall decals? // Zandro bug - http://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=20507
42: Redo idle sprites so both gun and sword are visible, sword on the left and gun on the right. Reverse all sword attacks.
45: Anon says: It feels like Demonsteele's sword need a tiny bit more range. Trying to hit Arachnotrons doesn't always work and it can't even touch a Mastermind(But that might be intentional)
46: HammerCharge needs a smaller/new ammo icon.
47: Gun impact sounds on flesh and walls
48: Convert .wav files to .ogg for size compression.
53: Iron Maiden polishing
  ^ Kick/chop sprites/sounds replacing the special moves
  ^ Pickup sprite/sound replacing BFG9000
60: <torridGristle> Watersplashes aren't the same colour as the water.
<torridGristle> Yeah, they're PNGs and aren't affected by the new playpal.
<torridGristle> Converting them to Doom format using the Doom palette, not the DemonSteele palette, should fix that well enough.
<torridGristle> Filesize actually decreases.
<torridGristle> Might want to go ahead and convert all the splashes into Doom format, Doom palette, so it's changed to the same colours as everything else when the new palette is in use.
62: Emperor's teleport doesn't show up online.
63: <PresidentPeople> TerminusEst13: You can interrupt the shotgun reload sound by jumping in Demonsteele
66: [07:30:53 pm] kenny: what about the invulnerability sphere stack
[07:31:02 pm] Jung Hae-Lin: Eh?
[07:31:10 pm] Ethril: if you pick up invuln while you already got one going
[07:31:13 pm] Ethril: it goes into your inventory
[07:31:19 pm] Ethril: you can carry around a bunch of PowerShields
67: The Blind Guardian, when damaged and then healed, stays in the damage state until pained.


<PresidentPeople> Hey Term, suggestion.  Make Armoire/Healf bonuses give combo or DMC meter
