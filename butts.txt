TO DO in no particular order:
1b: Implement found headshot dead sprites--imps/zombies/shotgunners will be finished!
4: Make pickup sprites for the weapons
8: Berserk pickup sprite/sound
9: Cvar to remove recoil/vertical movement off dodging for semi-purist play.
13: Forward, Left, right, and both attack buttons activates Iron Maiden mode
17: Polish up hammer's placeholder sprites--they're just placeholder, but they don't need to be so damn ugly
20: Mid-air flight sounds for projectiles, so as to easily gauge location.
22: Randomized muzzleflashes for the pistol.
23: Replace not-especially-demonic enemies with recolored/tweaked Heretic/Hexen enemies for more \m/ METAL \m/
    PAIN ELEMENTAL: Riever
    ARACHNOTRON:
    SPIDER MASTERMIND: Heresiarch
24: Include Shivers' idle animation
25: Respawning gives too much health
29: SASS RAINBOW: you should make berserk give free combos for 20 seconds
30: Easy path to S--find group of enemies, sword-dash into them
32: <TerminusEst13> ...I wonder if there's a way I can choke how much [combo meter] is given at once.
    <ijon> store the amount you have right when you start the attack
    <ijon> have ACS or custominventory or something check that and only give you more if it'd place you no more than X above that count
34: Replace explosive barrels with something of neater substance.
35: Replace generic blood with something of neater substance, like Psychic's or a smaller version of AtM's.
37: Pretty up all non-laser enemy attacks, like the fireballs.
38: I can include different melee styles, each with their own focus. People have been constantly suggesting more DMC inspiration, so one thing I could do is borrow the four "styles" of play and do different melee modes around that.
Like one style is to tap repeatedly for really fast strikes (what's currently in).
Another style is retro SNES-style beat-'em-up combos where landed hits go into other hits.
Another style is single strikes, where holding down fire charges up a more powerful strike.
And the final style...ummm. Hm.
39: Replace graphics on main menu options.
42: Redo idle sprites so both gun and sword are visible, sword on the left and gun on the right. Reverse all sword attacks.
43: GLDEFS
44: Expand on final map.


<PresidentPeople> Hey Term, suggestion.  Make Armoire/Healf bonuses give combo or DMC meter

<PresidentPeople> Also I suggested slash decals and coopinfo displaying combo meter

<Mystical> spinning skull for the menu screen selection cursor
<Mystical> skull with a  pointer for mouse


<PresidentPeople> TerminusEst13: Wraithverge needs to be in butts.txt
<TerminusEst13> butts.txt has been deleted.
<TerminusEst13> rip
<PresidentPeople> Replaced with to_do.txt, same thing :P
<TerminusEst13> Brb renaming to_do.txt to butts.txt
<Roman6a> >no butts.txt
<Roman6a> dead mod
<TerminusEst13> fug you i just put it back in
<Roman6a> oh, good
<PresidentPeople> >Wraithverge still isn't on it


DONE:
1a: Code Mike's new deaths
2: Make aura placeholders for Zael's Slayer of Light
3: Hammer overcharge crashes online play--due to HammerLightningLonger sucking up all the bandwidth. Find alternative?
4b: Find names for the weapons, make pickup sounds
5: Convert custominventory weapon pickups from Inventory.PickupSound to A_PlaySoundEx, currently don't activate with sv_weaponstay
6: More destructable environmental stuff
7: Figure out what armor pickups should be
10: Port in Mike's pistol sprites
11: More dramatic sound/effect for dodging
12: Back-back-slash is a wide sword beam shooting ahead a repulsive wave to defend yourself with
14: Redo shotgunner's/chaingunner's firing sound.
15: Give newer, prettier graphic for zombie laser shots than just an NES Contra sprite.
16: M_DOOM logo
18: Sound on enemy-laser impact
19: Give each of the guns/special attacks their own damagetype.
21: Stylize up the HUD a little.
23: Replace not-especially-demonic enemies with recolored/tweaked Heretic/Hexen enemies for more \m/ METAL \m/
    SPECTRE: Sabreclaw
    CACODEMON: Dark Bishop
26: In multiplayer people can cut each other up for combo
27: sv_unblockplayers allows people to go through enemies.
28: Less particle spam on Exodus.
31: Fountain-blood corpses seem to be looping endlessly online.
33: Make all enemy projectiles go A_UnsetShootable on death.
36: Edit the LANGUAGE lump and replace existing messages with more metal references.
40: Lightning sparks from hammer overcharge need to +DONTSPLASH
41: Why do the Hell Nobles/Cacos not have colored blood wall decals? // Zandro bug - http://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=20507
45: Anon says: It feels like Demonsteele's sword need a tiny bit more range. Trying to hit Arachnotrons doesn't always work and it can't even touch a Mastermind(But that might be intentional)
46: HammerCharge needs a smaller/new ammo icon.
