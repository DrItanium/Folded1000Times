FROM 0.73 TO 0.74:
=======================================
- The Archvile's flame turrets now have A_NoBlocking in their death state.
- All of the Archvile's death states now call A_KillChildren.
- The Archvile's flame turrets now are no longer considered monsters and won't spam up the monster count or block things in Invasion.
- There are three more "fade from black" sounds, thanks to torridGristle's rip of Eternal Darkness and thanks to MAGIX Soundpool DVDs.
- The Exodus grenades now explode on the sky, rather than simply vanish.
- The Icon of Sin now has its own custom sounds.
- Hae-Lin's landing sound is now less crackly.
- Pickups are now no longer considered monsters and will no longer bork things up in survival invasion.
- The initial swing of the Kharon's sheathe can now be refired one tic faster. Whoo.
- The Wolfenstein SS now has a replacement.
- Decorations now have a slightly higher chance to spew out items.
- In lieu of the Kamehameha, the Exodus no longer needs to go through walls. The explosion is now simply a 256-radius explosive, rather than four explosives with 192 radius.
- The Kharon by itself now has idle animations. Oops.
- Transformation has been streamlined and no longer requires "hold fire"--just hit Use Inventory and it'll activate.
- Online, people were occaisionally getting weapon desynchs, where they were in Iron Maiden but using the Kharon. This has been fixed.
- A new idle animation has been implemented.
- Hammering the ground will now allow Hae-Lin to jump higher, because reasons. The higher the charge, the higher the jump.
- The Iron Maiden's armor will become more effective depending on your rank--at S Rank, you can no-sell practically everything.
- The not-Kamehameha now takes a little over 1.5x as much soul energy but now each explosion does 128 damage instead of 96.
- There are no longer double decals for the bullet weapons.
- The switch-hitting no-damage bulletpuff no longer splashes on liquids.
- The Invulnerability Sphere and RadSuit now have their own respective appropriate replacements.
- The sound range on the not-Kamehameha has been tripled.
- Enemies killed with the not-Kamehameha are now no longer resurrectable.
- Meleeing enemies in pitch dark is a pain in the ass. For users who play with lower visibility settings and/or on dark maps, a flashlight has been provided. At the moment, it's an optional customizable key, but in the future (when Zandronum supports it) then it'll use the Reload key.
- The Omen and Iron Maiden are more responsive online and now has multiple checks for if the player has hit something with it. This should polish up all inconsistencies in hitting and should also reduce the amount of times people hit something and then get stuck in place.
- The Sentinel and the Blind Guardian can now be carried from level to level.
- The Infrared Visor has been replaced with a Sentinel pickup as well, which should make it slightly more common than just the allmap.
- The Archvile has +MISSILEEVENMORE removed.
- The Blackened's children now have a different appearance, to prevent confusion with Lost Souls.
- Lost Souls now drop souls when killed.
- The Blackened now has a sound when summoning its children, to prevent confusion of when a child is attacking or being summoned.
- Quakes no longer cause sounds.
- All enemies now have their own custom sound set. Whew! That was a lot of work.
- A few people's ears had trouble with the Kharon's sheathe, so the sheathing sound effect has been slightly softened, its pitch lowered, and its bass reduced.
- There is now an options menu for handling cvars and DemonSteele-specific settings, in ZDoom.
- New teleport effect. Neat!
- Hae-Lin now has lines for the not-Kamehameha. I can't think of a name for it, so neither can she.
- Hae-Lin now has lines for picking up food.
- In the chance a player picks up a new weapon DemonSteele doesn't replace, the ammo HUD will now show the ammo for it.
- ZDoom stealth monsters are now supported. Due to the gameplay style of DemonSteele, the monsters no longer flicker in and out of visibility, but are now a constant and flat 0.4 visibility.
- People tended to lose track of exactly how much health they had and would die accidentally. In true retro game style, now there is a beeping warning when low on health. This can be disabled with "ds_cl_nobeeping".
- Skulltag items and monsters now have a proper replacement. Skulltag monsters occaisionally recieve strange colors when killed, but for now this is a great step forward.
- Some people wanted to be able to taunt in ZDoom. Weird. There is now a ZDoom-specific key for doing the Zandronum taunt in ZDoom.
- The Blind Guardian will no longer trigger the Sentinel and send it into a Tumblr fit. In the off chance it does, the Sentinel will check its privilege and reassert itself.
- The Kharon's attacks no longer pass harmlessly through ghosts.
- The Keen now has a unique replacement.
- The techlamps are now destructable items, like the torches, and will now provide item drops.
- Techlamps and torches now have their original gldef lights back.
- Skulltag weapons now spawn their ordinary equivalents.
- Holding down fire for over a second will now prepare a launching uppercut slash. (Most) enemies launched with this will be suspended in mid-air until they hit the ground--shooting them will keep them in mid-air.

FROM 0.72 TO 0.73:
=======================================
- Hot splashes no longer alert enemies.
- Thanks to Scroton, the lightning of the hammer has been polished, optimized, and improved.
- ds_cl_toaster has been included as a clientside effects toggle option. 0 is full effects, 1 is less effects, 2 is absolute minimal effects.
- The Acacia's firing speed has been sped up slightly and now effectively fires as fast as you can pull the trigger. Its damage has also been upped by two, rendering it a powerful starting weapon out of the gate.
- On lower difficulties, with full over-life tokens, it's no longer possible to start nomming everything in sight with no benefit. Watch your intake, kids!
- There is now a Read This graphic for the Doom 1 menu.
- WHOOPS is now actually 1/10 chance instead of 1/100 chance.
- A few more attack sounds have been implemented.
- Weapons are no longer droppable. Sorry!
- Weapons now all have an addslotdefault entry in keyconf, in case there is a keyconf conflict when loaded with an older wad.
- Thanks to Scroton, destructable torches and candelabras now throw their items directly at the player.
- By request, all Kharon deaths now deliver the SPONG! Splatterhouse sound effect, for easy identification as to when an enemy has actually died.
- The Baron of Hell didn't trigger A_BossDeath on a few deaths. This has been fixed.
- As per Marrub's request, the hammer now has an ammo pickup item--HammerAmmoSmall, with DoomEd number of 30241.
- The Exodus is now capable of reflecting away enemy fire again.
- When out of soul meter, the meter slowly regenerates back to two notches, so you frequently have at least one special attack ready to go. This takes at least two minutes to regenerate.
- The Blind Guardian's sounds have had their bass reduced, treble amped, and volume amped by five decibels, which should make them sharper and much easier to notice.
- Numerous inventory checks in the ACS have been streamlined for more efficiency, which should (hopefully) reduce network traffic.
- The Blind Guardian now has an indicator on the HUD when the player has it equipped.
- The ammo being handled and fired from alt-fire has made the default auto-switching-when-out-of-ammo system a little finnicky. For those who really want a traditional system, though, ds_cl_autoswitch now lets people automatically switch weapons when out of ammo.
- There is now a very, very slim (1/255) chance for destructable decorations to drop peppers.
- The Allmap has been replaced with the Sentinel, an automatic sentient turret to gun enemies down for you.
- The Omen now has an incredibly sexy set of sprites, thanks to MartyKirra!
- The Blind Guardian's health has been increased to 1000.
- Explosive barrels have their damage increased and now have a much easier time downing mook enemies.
- Omen has been nerfed. Charging takes slightly longer, hitting an enemy with heavier attacks no longer allows you to follow up with an attack right afterwards, and the 100% charge attack now takes 40 charge instead of 20.
- The Hell Knight's torso no longer acts like it's from the Matrix.
- The Kharon's decals are now slashes.
- The Pinky now has a decapitation death, thanks to Sgt. Shivers.
- Higher-tier attacks of the hammer now always gib enemies on death.
- Explosive barrels now respect sv_barrelrespawn.
- The hammer's overcharged impact damage has been increased from 4000 to one million. This is functionally useless, as there isn't an enemy above 4000 HP anyway, but higher numbers sound cooler.
- The HUD now properly informs you as to what weapons you have picked up, as well as when you can use Iron Maiden.
- Revenants no longer have +ALWAYSFAST on them, and their missile-homing systems have been made slightly laggier, but the missiles themselves are now 1.5x faster.
- Cyberdemons can no longer infight with each other.
- The Iron Maiden now has a charge-up blast if alt-fire is held, which provides a rocket explosion for either AoE coverage or rocket-jumping.
- The Iron Maiden armor is now immune to environmental damage.
- Iron Maiden blasts now can be fired slightly faster, for more rapid ATATATATATATATATATATATA.
- The Iron Maiden now has a not-Kamehameha.
- ds_infinitesouls is now a cvar for the many people that requested a way to have, well, infinite soul meter.
- All of the more network-intensive deaths that spawn extra interactable actors have had their chance reduced for easier latency handling.
- Bisected torsos are no longer serverside actors.
- For those that don't like the special attacks, for some reason or another, ds_nospecials has been implemented.
- The constant ACS checks on the weapon spawns have been reduced to only one check, dramatically reducting bandwidth and network traffic.
- The Kharon is now able to be wielded by itself, along with its sheathe, for better defensive capabilities.
- Bisected torsos and weapon pickups no longer block enemy teleports.


FROM 0.71b TO 0.72:
=======================================
- Kharon slashing animation time has been reduced by two tics--now people can slash again as soon as the animation is complete.
- The animation for the upward slash has been spaced out slightly for more natural movement.
- Thanks to PresidentPeople, the Blind Guardian now has a proper set of rotations.
- The environment splash sprites now follow the same desaturated 90s palette.
- WHOOPS improved.
- Soul is slightly more transparent so as to not confuse it with enemy shots.
- When in Iron Maiden, Hae-Lin can now triple-jump, as opposed to simply double-jumping.
- The Blind Guardian no longer keeps a damaged appearance when repaired.
- Bullets online no longer spatter sparks on contact with enemies.
- The Testament's reload sound can no longer be interrupted by jumping.
- The Emperor's teleport effect properly works online, now.
- The Blackened now has +VISIBILITYPULSE on his main body for no other reason than it looks cool.
- Revenant missiles now home in 100% of the time and home much more aggressively. Enjoy!
- The Archvile's flame pillars no longer wander so wide out and have lost their multi-flame spread attack, but in exchange fire much more aggressively and spew out constant streams of attacks.
- Long, long ago in the mod's development, I made enemy projectiles shootable so that the pistol could shoot them down as well. As development went on, this proved too OP for the Testament and Sabbath and the ability was removed. The behavior has been tweaked, removing all of the vestigial bullet stuff while keeping the sword capable of cutting down projectiles.
- Because of this, this frees up the bullets' species to be able to shoot through allied players in co-op.
- For rare instances where you're trapped behind a forcefield or projectile-blocking wall or something and you need to shoot a switch, each bullet-gun has been given a perfectly accurate damage-less hitscan.
- The back special is now much more effective in destroying enemy shots.
- An attempt at making a 'less effects' cvar was made and quickly resulted in frustration, screaming, and grey hair. To make up for it, the effects on the Exodus, Omen, the explosive barrel, and Cyberdemon's rockets have been toned down slightly.
- Picking up multiple invulnerability powerups in a row no longer results in them getting stuffed in your inventory.
