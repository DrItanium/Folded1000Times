FROM 0.71b TO 0.72:
=======================================
- Kharon slashing animation time has been reduced by two tics--now people can slash again as soon as the animation is complete.
- The animation for the upward slash has been spaced out slightly for more natural movement.
- Thanks to PresidentPeople, the Blind Guardian now has a proper set of rotations.
- The environment splash sprites now follow the same desaturated 90s palette.
